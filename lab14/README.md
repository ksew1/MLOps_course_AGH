# Lab 14 - ML system design

This lab concerns designing ML systems, drafting architecture and tools,
debating tradeoffs and considerations.

Unlike previous labs, this one is based on group projects, done in person.
See [tasks.pdf](tasks.pdf) for description.

You are graded only based on the group work during the classes.
